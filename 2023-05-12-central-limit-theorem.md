The central limit theorem (CLT) is a powerful tool that allows us to make inferences about populations, even if we don't know the exact distribution of the population. Just wave your wand (i.e., use the CLT) over a sample of data, and the distribution of the sample means will be approximately normally distributed, regardless of the shape of the population distribution.

## Central Limit Theorem

 ![](/img/central-limit-theorem/sampling_distribution.png)

- **Population** <br>
The population of interest that we want to do some inference on (e.g. average height).

- **Sample** <br>
A large sample from the population (e.g. the height of 100 random people). <br>
  - Each of these samples, will have its <i> own distribution (i.e. sample distribution).</i>

- **Sample Statistic** <br>
A sample statistic is a *single* value that corresponds to the sample (e.g. mean). <br>
  *-* For each sample, we have a single 1-2-1 sample statistic.

- **Sampling Distribution** <br>
All of the sample statistics (e.g. means), have their own distribution named the **sampling distribution.**

> **Central Limit Theorem:** The sampling distribution of the mean is nearly normally centred at the population mean, with standard error equal to the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size.

> $\hat{x} \space \approx N(\text{mean} = \mu, \text{SE} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}})$

**Conditions for the CLT:**

1. *Independence:* <br>
*Sampled observations must be independent*. <br>
    a. If sampling without replacement, $n <10$%  of the population.

    > ðŸ’¡ We donâ€™t want to sample too large because it is highly likely that we will select an observation that is not independent. <br>
    > E.g. If a take a sample of myself, if I have a too large sample size, it is likely I will also sample my mother/father etc.

2. *Sample size/skew:* <br>
    a. Either the population distribution is normal. <br>
    b. Either the distribution is skewed, the sample size is large (rule of thumb: $n>30$). <br>

## Layman's Term Explanation

The *Central Limit Theorem* states that if any random variable, regardless of the distribution, is sampled a large enough number of times, the sample mean will be approximately normally distributed. This allows for studying the properties of any statistical distribution as long as there is a large enough sample size.

## Applications in Data Science

The CLT is a powerful tool that can be used to make inferences about populations. It is an important theorem for data scientists to understand.

Here are some additional examples of how the CLT is used in data science:

- *Machine learning:* <br>
The CLT is used in machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, logistic regression, and support vector machines.

- *Quality control:* <br>
The CLT is used to monitor the quality of products or services. For example, a company might use the CLT to ensure that the average weight of a bag of cereal is within a certain range.

- *Finance:* <br>
The CLT is used to calculate the probability of certain financial events, such as the probability of a stock price going up or down.

The CLT is a versatile tool that can be used in a variety of different applications. It is an important theorem for data scientists to understand.

## Mathematical Formulation

The Central Limit Theorem can be stated mathematically as follows:

Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with mean $\mu$ and finite variance $\sigma^2$. Then, as $n \to \infty$, the distribution of the standardized sample mean approaches the standard normal distribution:

$$\frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} \xrightarrow{d} N(0,1)$$

Where:
- $\bar{X} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i$ is the sample mean
- $\sigma/\sqrt{n}$ is the standard error of the mean

## Key Properties

### 1. Shape Convergence
Regardless of the original population distribution (uniform, exponential, binomial, etc.), the sampling distribution of the mean becomes approximately normal as $n$ increases.

### 2. Mean of Sampling Distribution
The mean of the sampling distribution equals the population mean: $E[\bar{X}] = \mu$

### 3. Variance of Sampling Distribution
The variance of the sampling distribution decreases as sample size increases: $Var[\bar{X}] = \frac{\sigma^2}{n}$

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Rolling Dice
Even though a single die roll follows a uniform distribution, the average of many dice rolls follows a normal distribution centered around 3.5.

### Example 2: Heights of People
If we repeatedly sample groups of 30 people and calculate their average height, these averages will be normally distributed around the population mean height.

### Example 3: Website Loading Times
Even if individual page load times are right-skewed, the average loading time across multiple samples will be approximately normal.

## Why the CLT Works

The theorem works because of the mathematical principle that sums of random variables tend toward normality. When we compute a sample mean, we're essentially adding up many random values and dividing by a constant (n). The randomness in individual observations tends to "cancel out" in the aggregate.

## Sample Size Considerations

### The "n â‰¥ 30" Rule of Thumb
While commonly cited, this rule isn't universal:
- **Symmetric distributions**: CLT applies even with small samples (n â‰¥ 10)
- **Moderately skewed distributions**: n â‰¥ 30 usually sufficient
- **Heavily skewed or extreme distributions**: May need n â‰¥ 100 or more

### Factors Affecting Sample Size Requirements
1. **Skewness**: More skewed distributions need larger samples
2. **Outliers**: Extreme outliers can slow convergence
3. **Desired accuracy**: Higher precision requirements need larger samples

## Real-World Applications

### Confidence Intervals
The CLT enables us to construct confidence intervals for population means:

$$\bar{x} \pm z_{\alpha/2} \cdot \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$$

### Hypothesis Testing
When testing hypotheses about population means, the CLT allows us to use the normal distribution even when the population isn't normal.

### A/B Testing
In digital marketing, the CLT justifies using normal distributions to analyze conversion rates and other metrics across different user groups.

### Quality Control
Manufacturing processes use the CLT to set control limits and detect when processes go out of specification.

## Limitations and Assumptions

### When the CLT Doesn't Apply
1. **Infinite variance**: Distributions like Cauchy don't satisfy CLT conditions
2. **Strong dependencies**: When observations are highly correlated
3. **Changing distributions**: When samples come from different populations

### Common Misconceptions
1. **Individual values become normal**: CLT applies to sample means, not individual observations
2. **Any sample size works**: Very small samples may not show normal behavior
3. **Perfect normality**: CLT provides approximation, not exact normality

## Connection to Other Statistical Concepts

### Relationship with Law of Large Numbers
- **LLN**: Sample mean converges to population mean
- **CLT**: Sample mean is approximately normally distributed

### Relationship with Standard Error
The CLT explains why standard error decreases with $\sqrt{n}$, not just $n$.

## Advanced Considerations

### Multivariate Central Limit Theorem
The CLT extends to multiple dimensions, enabling analysis of vector-valued random variables.

### Berry-Esseen Theorem
Provides bounds on how quickly the convergence to normality occurs.

### Functional Central Limit Theorem
Extends CLT to stochastic processes and time series data.

## Practical Implementation Tips

### 1. Check Your Data
- Examine histograms of your raw data
- Look for extreme outliers or unusual patterns
- Consider transformations for heavily skewed data

### 2. Choose Appropriate Sample Sizes
- Use larger samples for skewed data
- Consider the precision you need
- Balance statistical requirements with practical constraints

### 3. Validate Assumptions
- Test for independence of observations
- Check for constant variance across samples
- Verify that samples come from the same population

## Conclusion

The Central Limit Theorem is arguably one of the most important results in statistics. It bridges the gap between theoretical probability and practical data analysis, enabling us to:

- Make inferences about populations from sample data
- Construct confidence intervals and perform hypothesis tests
- Apply normal distribution tools to non-normal data
- Understand sampling variability and measurement uncertainty

For data scientists, mastering the CLT is essential because it:
- Justifies many statistical procedures used in machine learning
- Explains why averaging reduces noise in data
- Provides the foundation for understanding sampling distributions
- Enables rigorous statistical inference in practical applications

The magic of the CLT is that it turns the complexity of unknown population distributions into the simplicity of the normal distribution, making statistical inference both possible and powerful.
